/**
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following class provides an example of using JDBC to connect to an
 * Oracle database. The one phase of JDBC that is the most difficult and 
 * hard to achieve portability, is when connecting. This phase requires
 * that the Java database application specify driver-specific information that
 * JDBC requires in the form of a database URL.
 * 
 * If you run into problems while trying to simply make a connection, check
 * if they match any of the following:
 * 
 *    Connection fails with the message "Class no found"
 *    --------------------------------------------------
 *    This message usually results from not having the JDBC driver in your
 *    CLASSPATH. Ensure that if you are including *.zip and *.jar in your
 *    CLASSPATH, that your enter them explicity. If you put all of your *.class
 *    files and the ojdbc14.jar file containing the Oracle-JDBC driver into
 *    /u02/lib, your CLASSPATH should read /u02/lib:/u02/lib/ojdbc14.jar.
 *  
 *    Connection fails with the message "Driver no found"
 *    ---------------------------------------------------
 *    In this case, you did not register the JDBC driver with the DriverManager
 *    class. This example application describes several ways to register a
 *    JDBC driver. Sometimes developers using the Class.forName() method of
 *    registering a JDBC driver encounter an inconsistency between the JDBC
 *    specification and some JVM implementations. You should thus use the
 *    Class.forName().netInstance() method as a workaround.
 * 
 * When attempting to make a database connection, your application must first
 * request a java.sql.Connection implementation from the DriverManager. You will
 * also use a database URL and whatever properties your JDBC driver requires
 * (generally a user ID and password). The DriverManager in turn will search
 * through all of the known java.sql.Driver implementations for the one that
 * connects with the URL you provided. If it exhausts all the implementations
 * without finding a match, it throws an exception back to your application.
 * 
 * Once a Driver recognizes your URL, it creates a database connection using
 * the properties you specified. It then provides the DriverManager with a 
 * java.sql.Connection implementation representing that database connection. The
 * DriverManager then passes that Connection object back to the application.
 * 
 * At this point, you may be wondering how the JDBC DriverManager learns about
 * a new driver implementation. The DriverManager actually keeps a list of
 * classes that implement that java.sql.Driver interface. Something needs to 
 * register the Driver implementation for any potential database drivers it
 * might require with the DriverManager. JDBC requires a Driver class to
 * register itself with the DriverManager when it is initiated. The act of
 * instantiating a Driver class thus enters it in the DriverManager's list.
 * 
 * This class (ConnectionExample) provides three ways to register a driver.

    /**
     * The following method provides an example of how to connect to a database
     * by registering the JDBC driver using the Class.forName() method. This
     * complex expression is a tool for dynamically creating an instance of
     * a class when you have some variable representing the class name. Because
     * a JDBC driver is required to register itself whenever its static
     * initializer is called, this expression has the net effect of registering
     * your driver for you. 
     *
     *      NOTE: When using Class.forName("classname"), the JVM is supposed to
     *            be sufficient. Unfortunately, some Java virtual machines do
     *            not actuall call the static intitializer until an instance of
     *            a class is created. As a result, newInstance() should be 
     *            called to guarantee that the static initializer is run for
     *            all virtual machines.
     *
     * This method is by far the BEST in that it does not require hardcoded 
     * class names and it runs well in all Java environments. In real-world
     * applications, you should use this method along with a properties file
     * from which you load the name of the driver.
